# Longest String

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# longest_string is a method that takes an array of strings as its input
# and returns the longest string
#
# +list_of_words+ is an array of strings
# longest_string(list_of_words) should return the longest string in +list_of_words+
#
# If +list_of_words+ is empty the method should return nil


# Your Solution Below
def longest_string(list_of_words)
  longest_word = list_of_words[0]
  list_of_words.each do |n|
    if n.length > longest_word.length
      longest_word = n
    end
  end
  return longest_word
end


#Refactored
def longest_string(list_of_words)
  list_of_words.sort_by! { |word| word.length }
  return list_of_words [-1]
end
