  <div class="reflection">
    This was a really useful challenge and great practice for playing with a responsive website. I was a little confused about calculating the pixels to a percentage but after doing some additional research I started to understand. At first I focused on just converting all the pixels to a percentage. Once I was able to scale down the screen size and keep everything in proportion I started working on a media query. It was challenging to get the navbar under the header but eventually I was able to get it. I got to a point where I'm happy with the responsiveness of my website but I'm wondering if I could have done it in a better way.
