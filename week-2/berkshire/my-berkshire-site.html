- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was a good transition because the site we worked on was simple. All the tags we used during this challenge were tags that I had read a lot about in previous lessons. It was also a good way to practice using HTML5 tags like header, section, and footer.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We were able to effectively research and make decisions on which HTML5 tags to use during this challenge. It was helpful to be able to discuss the different tags with another person and think throgh which ones to use and why. There are so many resources out there but the one that proved to be most helpful was an HTML5 flowchart listed as a resource in a previous challenge.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think we did well sticking to the best practices of using HTML5 syntax, no HTML formatting, and using correct indentation.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems like a good way to create an outline of the website. It's a chance to make sure the website information is organized and has a nice flow to it. The bad part is the lack of formatting and design elements. You can format with HTML of course but the code would soon become cluttered and hard to read.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I just think of HTML like the skeleton of the website and start outlining the tags in a logical order from top to bottom (header, body, footer, etc.). One trick I always use is to immediately close a tag after opening one so I don't forget to close it later on. This has helped cut down on silly errors like an open tag.
