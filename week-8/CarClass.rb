# 2. Pseudocode
#Create a car object
#Create an initialize method:
  #Input: model, color
  #Output: none
  #Steps:
    #Create a variable for car and model
    #Create a variable for speed
    #Create a variable for distance
#Create a drive method
  #Input: distance to drive
  #Output: statement that you drove x amount of miles
  #Steps:
    #Add given distance to distance variable
    #Return distance variable
#Create a speed method
  #Input: none

    #Add difference between desired speed and current speed to current speed
    #Return current speed
#Create an decelerate method
  #Input: desired speed
  #Output: statement telling you your current speed
  #Steps:
    #Subtract difference between desired speed and current speed from current speed
    #Return current speed
#Create a distance travelled method
  #Input: none
  #Output: Return the total distance traveled
  #Steps:
    #Return the distance variable
