 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.
var adam = {
  name: "Adam",
}

terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {};
terah.children.carson = {name: "Carson"};
terah.children.carter = {name: "Carter"};
terah.children.colton = {name: "Colton"};
adam.children = terah.children;


// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
//What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
  //I had trouble adding the carson property as an object. I was skipping the part where I had to first add carson as a property and kept trying to add name as property directly to the terah children property. Once I broke down what I was doing into little steps I was able to figure out I was just missing a step. That worked becasue I was able to visualize better what the test was asking me to do.
// How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
  //It wasn't difficult for me to add or delete properties.
// What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
  //I solidifed my learning of how to add objects as properties of other objects. Manipulating objects in JavaScript isn't that different from Ruby, just some differences in syntax.
