// Design Basic Game Solo Challenge

// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description:
// Overall mission:
  //You're an astronaut and you need to get back to the spaceship. There is a martian trying to stop you so you have to shoot at him as you make your way back to safety.
// Goals:
  //Get back to spaceship while avoiding the martian
  //Shoot the martian
// Characters:
  //Astronaut
  //Martian
// Objects:
  //Astronaut
    //Properties: x coordinate, y coordinate, shoot, move
  //Martian
    //Properties: x coordinate, y coordinate
  //Spaceship
    //Properties: x coordinate, y coordinate
  //Raygun
    //Properties: x coordinate, y coordinate
// Functions:
  //Move astronaut
    //This will change his coordinates
    //If his coordiantes are the same as the martian, he dies
    //If his coordinates are the same as the sapceship, he wins
  //Shoot raygun
    //This changes the raygun coordinates
    //If the raygun coordinates are the same as the martian you win
  //Move martial
    //This will change his coordinates

// Pseudocode
//Create the astronaut object
  //Add properties:
    //Add x and y coordinates as propeties set to 0
    //shoot: a function that changes the x and y coordinates of the raygun
      //IF the raygun coordinates are the same as the martian - you win
    //move: a function that changes x and y coordinates of the astronaut and the martian
      //IF the coordinates are the same as the martians - you lose
      //IF the coordinates are the same as the spaceship - you win
//Create the martian object
  //Add x and y coordinates as propeties set to 0
//Create the spaceship object
  //Add x and y coordinates as propeties set to 0
//Create the raygun object
  //Add x and y coordinates as propeties set to 0
