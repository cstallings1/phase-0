### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
1. Create a Repo:
  - Login to your GitHub account
  - Click the green "+ New Repository" button on the right side
  - Put a name in the "Repository Name" box. Keep it concise.
  - Make sure "Public" is selected
  - Select the "MIT License" in the "Add a license box" at the bottom of the page
  - Click "Create Repository" and then you'll see it in your profile
2. Clone the Repo:
  - In your GitHub profile, select the new repo you just created
  - Copy the clone URL located on the right side of the screen
  - Open your terminal, you can search for terminal in spotlight search
  - Type -git clone <Copied URL> in the terminal and hit enter. You can now add files to your repo.

### Describe what open source means.
Open source means that anybody can look at your source code and try to add to it.

### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
At this point I don't feel nervous about sharing code because I'm not writing advanced prorams that people would want to use or change. I love open source because I can expose myself to different styles and programming languages, and I think that great things can come out of collobarating with people all over the world.

### Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licensing is important because it manages the way your open source code can be used; this is important when your source code can be accessed by millions of people. Some licenses, like the MIT license are very permissive; a user can do just about anything with the code as long as they also include the license agreement.

### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge really helped me get a better understanding of pulling, pushing, and merging in git and GitHub. I was still a little confused by the last exercise but the repetition has already helped me to understand it better.

### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I was a little confused by the different types of licenses so I also read these articles:
