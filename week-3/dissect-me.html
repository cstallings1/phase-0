			<h2>Git and Version Control</h2>

				What are the benefits of version control?
				Before discussing the benefits of version control we should define it beforehand. Version control is a system of tracking that allows any modifications or changes to be traced back to. What this means is simply if any changes are made that could potentially negatively affect a "version" of a project we can return to any previous version before this error or mistake and work from there. The benefits are enormous as it saves time and makes work more efficient. It also avoids work overlap when working and collaborating with others on more complicated projects. Git, the version control we will be discussing in this blog post, is the version control tool used on the website GitHub. It thus allows us to see who made which changes and when and makes work a lot more efficient.

				How does git help you keep track of changes?
				There are three stanges to a change on git. The first,the working stage, is basically the first step when you are working on a file in a directory and making any modifications. This stage is untracked or isn't saved yet. The second stage when you would like to add the modifications before "committing" them or saving them is the "staged". When you are done working and want to save your progress ( just like a checkpoint in a videogame) you then "commit" the last stage of git stages. These three steps allow to ensure modifications are made properly and once saved you can see when the change was made and who made the change as well with a simple "git log" command on the command line.

				Why use GitHub to store your code?
				GitHub is a remote hub. On GitHub you can store your code and collaborate on projects with other developers. This community and "social" coding website is a great haven to store code because it allows others to look at your code before you submit to your master branch ( where all your working code is!) and adds an extra layer of protection. Not too get too much in depth with GitHub lingo, but you do this by making a "Pull request" which basically lets others know that you'd like your code to be reviewed.

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
The HTML5 tags I've used over and over are section and article because they help define the content of the page. These tags help to organize your information in a logical way; this important for people reading your code and it makes it easier on yourself when writing the CSS.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements get laid out on a page like an outline. You lay out the main components such as <html>, <header>, and <body> and then fill in with more specific content using headers, paragraphs, sections, etc. The browser reads the html form the top down. So a header put above a paragraph will display in that order.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I did not know that you could create your own snippets in Sublime before this challenge. I knew about packages like Emmett but it's nice to know that I can create my own snippets specific to my needs. Now that I know about this I will definitely keep it in mind and create some some that might apply for other languages. I did do a quick search and quickly found some pre-existing snippets that I can start using. -->
