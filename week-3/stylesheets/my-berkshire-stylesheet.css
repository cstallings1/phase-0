/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It's important to remember to include all attributes of the link tag (type, rel, and href). Equally important is to include the link in the <head> tag so the browser reads it before getting to the main part of the webpage.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We used floats to get the two colums positioned correctly and this worked out really well. We definitely tried some things that didn't always work out but we were able to correct the issues by researching and trial and error.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why?
If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We used font-size, font-color, font-weight, and background-color mostly. We included both classes and ids. We used classes when we knew we were going to reuse the styling on different elements; we used ids if it was a style we were only using in one spot.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
I think that our code was cleaner because we actually used CSS, this made the HTML much easier to read and understand. The original site had so many nested elements it was hard to keep track of everything. We also made use of HTML5 where the original code had not been updated to the newer code yet. Now that I'm looking at it again, the original site did have better padding around the elements of the page so I would say that could be improved on our site.
